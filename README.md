# OpenExchangeRatesMicroservice
A microservice that pulls the exchange rates desired by the user from the website Open Exchange Rates. And then it save the data to personal database.

In this project, I built an api microservice using java spring and mongodb. The microservice fetches the current exchange rates from "https://www.openexchangerates.com"
as a response to a request. And then, it automatically saves the fetched exchange rates to a mongoDb database.
